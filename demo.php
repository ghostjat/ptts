What Is Constructor Property Promotion?
Constructor property promotion allows you to declare a propertyâ€™s visibility (public, protected, or private), its name, and optionally its type directly in the constructorâ€™s parameter list.
The compiler then automatically generates the corresponding property and initializes it with the provided argument when creating an object1.
How Does It Work?
To create a promoted property, prefix its name with a class visibility modifier (public, protected, or private).
Once promoted, the property behaves like any other class property.
